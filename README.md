# Advanced_Scientific_Python_course_project
This is a repository with the code for the final project for the Advanced Scientific Python course (2019)


## Project: Conway's Game of Life

Instructions for running:

The animation is initialized by running the "run.py" file. 
By default, the seed is a cross-shaped matrix. The seed can be replaced by a random matrix by editing the "run.py" file.
The module called modules.py contains all the functions necessary for the program to run.

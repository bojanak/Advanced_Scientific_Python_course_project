# Advanced_Scientific_Python_course_project
This is a repository with the code for the final project for the Advanced Scientific Python course (2019)


## Project: Conway's Game of Life

This is a "trial" version of the program.

The modules that it uses are in the "modules.py" file.
Other dependencies: numpy and matplotlib.


It should be run from a terminal window, by running the "run.py" script.
By default, the seed is a random matrix. The seed can be replaced by a cross-shaped matrix by editing the "run.py" file.
